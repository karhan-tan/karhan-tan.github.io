# Multiview Mirror Pyramid Panoramic Cameras

Panoramic images and video are useful in many applications 
such as special effects, immersive virtual reality environments, and video 
games. Among the numerous devices proposed for capturing panoramas, mirror 
pyramid-based camera systems are a promising approach for video rate 
capture, as they offer single-viewpoint imaging, and use only flat mirrors 
that are easier to produce than curved mirrors. To date, the designs 
proposed typically capture panoramas from a single viewpoint. 

A mirror pyramid consists of a set of flat mirror faces arranged around 
      an axis of symmetry, inclined to form a pyramid. By strategically 
      positioning a number of conventional cameras around a mirror pyramid, the 
      viewpoints for the individual camerasâ€™ mirror images can be colocated at a 
      single point within the pyramid, effectively forming a virtual camera with 
a wide field of view.

Mirror pyramid-based panoramic cameras have a number of attractive 
      properties, including

   * single-viewpoint imaging 
   * high resolution, and 
   * video rate capture.
