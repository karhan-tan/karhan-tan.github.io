Panoramic images and video are useful in many applications 
such as special effects, immersive virtual reality environments, and video 
games. Among the numerous devices proposed for capturing panoramas, mirror 
pyramid-based camera systems are a promising approach for video rate 
capture, as they offer single-viewpoint imaging, and use only flat mirrors 
that are easier to produce than curved mirrors. To date, the designs 
proposed typically capture panoramas from a single viewpoint. 

A mirror pyramid consists of a set of flat mirror faces arranged around 
an axis of symmetry, inclined to form a pyramid. By strategically 
positioning a number of conventional cameras around a mirror pyramid, the 
viewpoints for the individual camerasâ€™ mirror images can be colocated at a 
single point within the pyramid, effectively forming a virtual camera with 
a wide field of view.

Mirror pyramid-based panoramic cameras have a number of attractive 
properties, including

   * single-viewpoint imaging 
   * high resolution, and 
   * video rate capture

Previous designs realize a single viewpoint within each 
mirror pyramid. In order to capture panoramas from multiple viewpoints 
with these designs, the entire physical setup would need to be relocated 
or duplicated. The former solution lacks the capability of video rate 
imaging, and the latter leads to bulky designs due to the multiple mirror 
pyramids.

In our paper we proposed a method for generalizing existing designs 
such that multiple viewpoints can be created in a single mirror pyramid. 
This enables simultaneous multiview panoramic video rate imaging with a 
compact design.

position with viewpoint position. (a) Viewpoint is centered in four-sided 
pyramid, shown with the corresponding eight camera positions. (b) 
Translated viewpoints marked A, B, and C are shown with correspondingly 
marked physical camera positions. (c) Same as (b), but with a mirror 
pyramid with a large number of faces to show how the shape changes as the 
viewpoint translates.
